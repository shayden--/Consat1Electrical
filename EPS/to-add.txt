x change NCS2202 to NCS2200
* |- alternately: find drop in replacement for NCS2200 that has higher tolerance on Vin ( LT1716HS5 )
* remove R11 and R28
* route the Iprg line on IC4

* add always-on 3.3v regulator for very low power devices
* add input and output filtering caps to ALL 
find voltage reading chip that has high impedance inputs when it is powered down
solar panel grounds and battery grounds are connected, does this need to change ( change through wiring harness )
add line to enable external charging of batteries (through wiring harness?)
connect 5V reg output to transciever RF amp? ( H2-46 )
