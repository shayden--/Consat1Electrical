ad7889 with measurement points to:

+battery thermistor 1
+battery thermistor 2
+solar panel Vsense 1 ( tgt = 5uA for 15v, therefore Req = 3Meg,  )
+solar panel Vsense 1


additional external ground to umbilical cable for charging
+current reset circuit with dedicated 3v regulator
+external hiccough reset line
+increase power transistor PCB footprint


reset radio line - resetled? setled? max radio current?


check if AD219 has bi-directional current flow sense
double check VD for battery heater control
add thermal layers!
add the line to send a current warning to the Q6
add documentation layer, with name, schematic, icon, etc
